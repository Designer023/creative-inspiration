#Introduction


There are a lot of useful resources and inspirational sites across multiple fields. This site documents the ones that are most useful to me. The intent is that it will be the site I wish I had had when I started learning **[insert topic]**.

The topics are broken down by general principals, then specialities. The resources are listed for each topic, as needed. The lists are broken down by type e.g. Newsletter, websites, book etc so it's easier to browse resources for the resource type you are currently looking for.

- Blogs & articles - Sites that have lots of blogs and articles about topics. Widen those horizons.
- Articles - Single articles.
- Presentations, talks and speakers - let someone explain it to you.
- Learning - Take up the mantle and learn something new or improve what you already have.
- Tutorials - Be shown how to do it.
- Newsletters - Sit back and let the latest information be sent to you.
- People - Who to follow on twitter, facebook and other social media.
- Inspiration collections - Let the experts collect the inspiration. View hand picked work.

**The lists are a work in progress as I backtrack through bookmarks, emails and tweets for the useful ones**
